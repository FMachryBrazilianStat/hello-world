# hello-world
Just doing the guide...
First: sorry for my bad english, I think you've already noticed that's not my born language. Nevertheless, it's not all that bad, at least I've got a dozen (or half a dozen) of words and expressions in english :)

I think that very few - if any - people will read this. Anyway, let me introduce you: my name is FÃ¡bio Machry, I am Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro, by now (2015-11-14) I have 33, I am a B. Sc. statistician at UFRJ (short for Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and a fomer High School Math Teacher (I have also an undergraduate title at Mathematics Education). Yhe main reason why I am here is due to Coursera. Ay the moment I'm taking several courses for the track of Johns Hopkins' Data Science Specialization. I'm very excited about this specialization, I must say the truth and stress that studying with americans is much better than with brazilians. I have some kind of addiction for studying, specifically studying things about statistics and data analysis, so this series of Data Science courses is being just about perfect for me.

Soon I'll come back to this file telling more about my study projects. Meanwhile, if you are interested in being my study parter, please take a look at my website: www.im.ufrj.br/~fmachry (just in portuguese; soon I intend doing this website in english as well).
